    <h1>Books are an important part of our life</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><i>We read many kinds of books. We study text books at school that are part of our syllabus.
    
    We also have story books that we read for leisure and fun. We can get them from the school library. We can also buy them
    from bookshops. Books are printed on paper, and can have pictures too that make them interesting. We can read books on
    the computer as well.</i>
